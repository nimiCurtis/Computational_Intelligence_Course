# Computational_Intelligence_Course

## Overview

This package exclusively offers the hands-on exercises taught in the CI (Computational Intelligence) course lectures held at the engineering department of Tel-Aviv University.

The course provides an introductury-level coverage of the following key topics:
1. Genetic algorithmes 
2. Swarm optimization
3. Fuzzy logic and control
4. Machine Learning
5. Deep Neural Networks

## Content

Content of the course by exercises:

- **Exercise 1** - Divided into two parts:
    - 1. Setting up the course environment (assuming students are using Anaconda and PyCharm)
    - 2. Concise overview of the main Python libraries covered in the course.

- **Exercise 2** - Genetic algorithms.
- **Exercise 3** - Swarm Intelligence - PSO (Particles Swarm Optimization).
- **Exercise 4 - 5** - Fuzzy logic and Fuzzy control inference systems.
- **Exercise 6 - 7** - Machine Learning - classification & regression tasks.
- **Exersice 8 - 11** - Introduction to Deep Learning.
